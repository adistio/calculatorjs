# Simple Calculator Project

This is a simple web-based calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This project demonstrates:
- Basic DOM manipulation in JavaScript.
- A responsive user interface created with CSS.
- Usage of the `eval()` function to evaluate the mathematical expressions inputted by the user.

## Features

- **Clear button**: Allows users to reset the current input and start fresh.
- **Basic operations**: Supports addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).
- **Responsive design**: The calculator is designed to be mobile-friendly and responsive across different screen sizes.
- **Error Handling**: Displays "Error" if the user enters an invalid expression.
